				<h4>Introduction</h4>
			</div>
			<p>I am currently a Computer Science major at Rowan University. The majority of my programming
			   experience has been in Java. However, I also have experience with HTML, CSS, SQL, and some 
		       Javascript. I can also read and debug C++, Python, and C#, but I have never written in these
		       languages. I am also learning how to do Firebase function calls.

					<h4>Space Combat Simulation</h4>
				</div>
				<p>I am a large fan of Star Wars and was interested in being able to simulate battles between fleets.
				   This program allows you to build 2 different fleets from 15 ship classes and 200 types. After that,
		           it allows you to go round by round and view the progression of the battle.

					<h4>RPG Character Creator</h4>
				</div>
			<p>This is a character creation program for an RPG game I am slowly designing.</p>

				<h4>RedBox Simulation</h4>
			</div>
			<p>This is a project that I helped with in one of my classes. The goal of the project was to simulate sales
		       of a RedBox Machine over a period of 10 days. We were able to accomplish that relatively early into the 
		       project, so we decided to expand it a little. The final version created a random amount of redboxes spread
		       out over a city. Customers are assigned houses and travel to and from the redboxes as they rent and return
		       movies and games.

				<h4>Simple Movement</h4>
			</div>
			<p>The goal of this program to allow me to test simple movement algorithms.</p>
